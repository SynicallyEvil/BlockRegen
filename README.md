# BlockRegen

BlockRegen is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin that allows you to create regenerative ore nodes like you see in MMOs.

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Wertik/BlockRegen/releases/latest).

Watch a video about how this plugin works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiMwm317oaA&ab_channel=SoulStriker).

## Supported versions

``1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21`` (as of 3.10.8)

Even though versions below 1.16 are supported. This plugin requires at least java 17 to run.

### Notes

* Versions 1.8 (and any below) don't support boss bars for events or particles.
* For materials on version 1.12 (and below) use their 1.13+ names.
  * ex.: Cyan dye -> ~~INK_SACK;4~~ CYAN_DYE
  * You can find a list of materials [here](https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XMaterial.java).

## Development

If you wish to contribute or develop a fork of the plugin for yourself, you're more than welcome to.
Be sure to open a PR if you implement anything that could be meaningful for others using the plugin!

In order to install local dependencies distributed with the source, run `mvn initialize`. \
This is done because there's no public repository to take the latest dependencies from.
